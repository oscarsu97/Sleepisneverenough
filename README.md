# Sleepisneverenough

Our app is designed to allow users to visualise their mental wellness across a period of time. Users write journal entries for their day and rate their mood for that day. Then, they will able to see a coloured dot on the calendar day, representing their mood. The colour ranges from red(negative mood) to yellow to green(positive mood).

We believe that our app has two benefits for users. First of all, as a journal app, it allows them to vent their emotions by writing down their thoughts for the day instead of bottling their emotions. Secondly, they are able to see their emotions through a month and if they are going through a rut (lots of red in a period of day) then they would know that they should seek help from friends/family/medical professionals. We believe that the key to mental wellness starts with mental awareness.
